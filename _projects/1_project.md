Thermal management is the current bottleneck in the advancement of high-power integrated circuits (ICs), and phase change heat sinks are a promising solution. With a unique structural configuration consisting of a membrane positioned above the heater surface, membrane-based heat sinks (MHS) have thus far attained  heat fluxes of up to 2 kW/cm2 and HTC of up to 1.8 MW/m2K using water as the working fluid. This work reports the latest progress and performance evaluation of MHS for high flux thermal management.
