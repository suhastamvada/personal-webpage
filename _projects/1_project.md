# Membrane Heat Sink Project

## Overview

Thermal management is the current bottleneck in the advancement of high-power integrated circuits (ICs), and phase change heat sinks are a promising solution. With a unique structural configuration consisting of a membrane positioned above the heater surface, membrane-based heat sinks (MHS) have thus far attained  heat fluxes of up to 2 kW/cm2 and HTC of up to 1.8 MW/m2K using water as the working fluid. We are currently working on developing these heat sinks for data center cooling.

## Project Goals

### 1. **Efficiency Enhancement**
   - Investigate the efficiency gains offered by membrane-based heat sinks over traditional air cooling methods.
   - Evaluate the cooling performance under various workloads and operating conditions.

### 2. **Environmental Impact**
   - Assess the environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption and data center carbon footprints.

### 3. **Practical Implementation**
   - Develop practical implementation guidelines for integrating membrane heat sinks into existing data center infrastructure.
   - Collaborate with industry experts to ensure real-world feasibility.
