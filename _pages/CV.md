  - Thesis topic: Physics of Critical Heat Flux - Answers to Century Old Questions and New Discoveries
  - Advisor: Prof. Saeed Moghaddam
- **MS in Mechanical Engineering** - University of Illinois at Chicago (2017-2020)
  - Thesis topic: [Partial Coalescence of Oil and Water: Spreading Behavior and Material Synthesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/7daf849c1a172f5f50f3b07b0b4f3fc7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)
  - Advisor: Prof. Sushant Anand

## Experience
### Post-Doctoral Associate - University of Florida (2024-Present)
**Responsibilities**:
- Currently lead a team of 5 graduate students and a Post-Doctoral researcher to develop direct-to-chip phase change cooling technology for data centers (DC). Oversee daily operations, develop scalable packaging processes, characterize reliability of heat sinks, TIMs, and membranes, and perform techno-economic analyses (TEA) for assessing feasibility of heat sink commercialization. Demonstrated proof-of-concept of membrane based heat sinks for DC environments. Achieved 10Ã— performance (HTC) compared to existing methods.

### Graduate Research Assistant - University of Florida (2020-2024)
**Responsibilities**:
- Designed and conducted experiments to investigate maximum heat flux (CHF) during phase change heat transfer (pool boiling). Proposed CHF limits based on energy balance exceed previous models by 400%.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, C++
- **Tools**: Git, LaTeX, SolidWorks

## Awards and Honors
- MAE Graduate Student Research Award, University of Florida, 2024
- Graduate Student Travel Award, IEEE iTherm, 2024
- Third place, MAE Student Poster Competition, University of Florida, 2022
