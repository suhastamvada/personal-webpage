Welcome to my Homepage! I am a PhD student at the [Nanostructured Energy Systems Laboratory](https://mae.ufl.edu/neslabs/index.html) at **University of Florida**. Currently, I am trying to understand the physics behind phase change heat transfer, specifically the pool boiling crisis, also known as Critical Heat Flux (CHF) limit. I also leverage this fundamental knowledge in conjunction with surface engineering techniques to develop thermal management solutions for multi-scale energy systems ranging from microelectronic chips in data centers to nuclear reactors.

Previously, I have investigated heat and mass transport at interfaces, phase change transport phenomena, and surface engineering. Although my work is primarily experimental, I enjoy exploring computational work in the domain of fluid dynamics and heat transfer. I am beginning to tinker with Machine Learning. 

I am working on updating the site to include all my projects and teaching experience. Keep an eye out for this space!
