Welcome to my Homepage! I am a PhD student at the [Nanostructured Energy Systems Laboratory](https://mae.ufl.edu/neslabs/index.html) at **University of Florida**. I am currently developing thermal management solutions for multi-scale energy systems including microelectronic chips, laser and defense equipment, and data centers. My current research focuses on deciphering the physics of pool boiling crisis, also known as Critical Heat Flux (CHF) limit.

I am interested in phase change transport phenomena, heat and mass transport at interfaces, and surface engineering. Although my work is primarily experimental, I enjoy exploring computational work in the domain of fluid dynamics. I am beginning to tinker with Machine learning.
